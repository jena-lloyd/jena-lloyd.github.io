<p><h2>
    I now understand the importance of having a portfolio or at least starting
     one. Either it is for art, personal growth, or even for professional use.
      What I learned from this experience is that is hard to start portfolio.
       When I do not have a set target audience and limited pieces to construct
        at collection. What I will do differently next time is plan better.
         I had initially planned on incorporating watercolor paintings with 
         my handmade works, but due to inconvenient timing it is not possible.
          If I had additional time would have been spent on more coded 
          assignments. It tasks me a long time to grasp the concepts or 
          at how the code is supposed to work properly. My studies in 
          Javascript has changed since last semester. Before, I was very 
          overwhelmed, struggled to keep up and ended up withdrawing from my 
          courses. As of now I managed to hang in there. It was difficult for
           me carry on, but I tried my best. There were times where I get stuck
            on a few lines of code or spending hours adjusting my assignment 
            submissions. I had be very honest with myself, my portfolio would
             need more work. This will be an on-going project even after I 
             graduate and I find this be a learning experience.
